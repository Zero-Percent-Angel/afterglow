0 - Don't act in bad faith/ Don't be a dick. We're all adults here, we want to be immersed in a world that isn't real for a little while on our weekends for fun. Be nice, and considerate of others. <br>
1 - Role play is everything here, it is expected that while you're playing as a character you do not break character and you conform to the lore and accept the consequences that would happen to your character when they take actions in the world in relation to such. <br>
We expect that characters are: A) Serious - No Joke/meme characters, B) Consistent with the setting, shouting 'Real' or 'Bruh' over the common radio is not something that any of the characters out of the first fallout game would do. Try to the resist the urge. C) Not a complete snowflake marysue, no character is good at everything while the skill system will largely prevent this that doesn't mean you should be pushing to find all the limits. <br>
2 - Don't argue with staff, when staff rule something in an ahelp accept it, it may not be what you want and they may well have made a mistake in the moment but getting mouthy about it in tickets isn't going to help is it? Raise a ticket in the discord after the round is over so everyone has had a chance to cool off. <br>
3 - No Meta-gaming; IC and OOC knowledge is to be kept separate, you may well know a character is a frumentarri for example but your character may have no way of knowing such. The same should apply to lore knowledge, you may well be a fallout guru who knows everything about the world, but would some raider from no-where really know the particulars of who governs san-Francisco if they're from 400 miles away? No. <br>
4 - No toxic behaviour; Feedback about features and staffing is fine when it is constructive, saying something is dogshit and jigging up a laughing mob is not. Likewise, do not talk negatively about others this is not an episode of mean girls. <br>
5 - Adult Content - Yes this server will allow 'ERP' hence the age check at the gate. However it's important to respect people's out of character boundaries, people may not want to act out certain scenes for example: if someone asks for a torture scene which was being RPed out to fade to black, respect that wish (it doesn't mean the bad thing hasn't happened to their character) <br>
6 - No advertising other servers; The new flavour of the month fallout server might be dropping, but this isn't the place to talk about it, the same goes for any other SS13 server.
7 - No past dramas, leave all that at the door. Nobody cares about what happened on the servers of yesteryear. <br>
